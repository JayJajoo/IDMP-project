## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing smart home sensor data to detect anomalies and classify activities. It incorporates efficient data management techniques and visualizations to provide actionable insights.  

---

## Dataset  
The dataset is stored in the `ARAS` folder.  

- **Source:** [ARAS Dataset](http://aras.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/download.php)  
- **Details:**  
  - Data collected from two houses (House A and House B).  
  - One month (30 days) of sensor readings.  
  - Includes data on residents’ activities and home environment.  

---

## Data Outputs  
All processed outputs, including identified anomalies, will be saved in the `ARAS` folder.  

---

## Features  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies irregularities in sensor readings.  
- **Activity Classification:** Classifies activities based on sensor data.  
- **Data Visualization:** Provides meaningful visual insights.  
- **Data Management:** Organizes and preprocesses raw data for analysis.
